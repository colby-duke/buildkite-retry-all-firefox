# buildkite retry

Hereâ€™s a Chrome extension with some useful Buildkite workflow shortcuts, currently including a button to retry all failed tests on your current buildkite page and a way to quickly report test-infra issues.
DISCLAIMER please retry responsibly and only use if you know that your tests are flaking due to reasons unrelated to your changes :slightly_smiling_face:
